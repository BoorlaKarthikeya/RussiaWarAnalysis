# Russia-loss-in-Russia-Ukrain-war

Embarking on a profound exploration, this project meticulously analyzes Russia's military losses throughout the Ukraine war, unraveling the intricate threads of conflict. 
Through a chronological lens, I tried to observe the evolving dynamics on diverse fronts, portraying the trajectory of Russia's diminishing military loss and casualies over time.
Graphical representations further illuminate the nuanced patterns, providing a visual grasp of the shifting landscapes.
Beyond data points, At its core, this project is not merely an analysis but a contribution to the global understanding of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
By shedding light on the military losses sustained by Russia,I aimed to foster a more informed discourse that transcends borders and perspectives.
In a world fraught with uncertainty, this project stands as a beacon of clarity, offering a comprehensive examination of Russia's military losses in the Ukraine war.
This project strives to foster a more informed discourse on the Russia-Ukraine war, encapsulating the essence of a conflict that resonates far beyond national borders.
By shedding light on the intricacies of military losses, I seek to facilitate a deeper understanding of the human, strategic, and geopolitical dimensions of this ongoing struggle, urging a collective effort towards peace and resolution.


## overview
This project analyzes Russian military losses, providing key insights into:
- Ariel losses (Aircraft, Helicopters, Drones)
- Naval losses (Ships, Submarines)
- Personnel losses
- Multi-domain integrated force losses (Tanks, APCs, Missiles, Anti-aircraft warfare)
- Strategic firepower division losses (Field Artillery, MRL, Special Equipment, Vehicles)

It aims to highlight the severity of losses, identify geographical areas of significant conflict, and visualize these patterns over time.

The data includes the following columns:
- `date`: Date of record.
- `aircraft`, `helicopter`, `drone`, `tank`, `APC`, `field artillery`, `MRL`, `naval ship`, `submarines`, `anti-aircraft warfare`, `vehicles and fuel tanks`, `personnel`, `POW`.
- `greatest losses direction`: Region with the highest losses for Russia on that date.
- `war_day`: Number of days since the conflict began.
